# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structure Prediction Tools
This repository contains code and data related to the bachelor thesis "Comparative Analysis of Protein Structure Prediction Tools", which compares the performance of AlphaFold2, ESMFold, and OmegaFold on proteins with recently published experimental structures. 

The folder `dataset_creation` contains two Jupyter notebooks for creating the dataset:
- `creating_dataset.ipynb` describes the process of selecting suitable protein structures from PDB
- `protein_loading.ipynb` contains code for downloading files necessary for further work and other preprocessing steps

The complete dataset is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hyskova-anna/proteins).

Notebooks for the prediction of protein structures are in the directory `protein_structure_prediction`, which also contains an example script `alphafold_prediction_example_script.sh` used for the protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 on [Metacentrum OnDemand](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/software/ondemand/).

Materials related to the evaluation of predicted structures are in the folder `evaluation`:
- `removing_complexes.ipynb` removes redundant protein chains labelled as "complex", chains selected for evaluation are in the file `chains_filtered.csv`
- `evaluation.ipynb` describes the process of counting selected metrics (average pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score) for all predictions, the results are saved as `chains_evaluation.csv`
- `badly_predicted_proteins.csv` visualizes selected structures and explores the question of whether there is an overlap between protein chains with low-quality predictions generated by different tools
- `statistics.Rmd` is an R Markdown file for statistical analysis of the data and generation of graphs

The last part of the analysis focused on exploring the relationship between the prediction quality and various characteristics of the proteins. The code and data are in the folder `evaluation_families`:
- `annotations.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that obtains the annotations for protein chains and protein families
- `protein_families.Rmd` tests the significance of the relationships and produces visualisations
- `data` is a folder containing all the outputted results
